# Project Name: Exploring Global Population Trends: A Data Visualization Project
By Mehul Chafekar
## Project Introduction
- Understanding global population trends is crucial for governments, policymakers, researchers, and businesses.
- Population data offers insights into demographic changes, economic growth, and social dynamics.
-This project aims to visualize world population data from 1960 to 2023, leveraging Python and various data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- By analyzing historical population data, we can uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies that can inform future planning and decision-making.

# Project Summary
- This project utilizes a dataset containing population data for various countries over the years 1960 to 2023.
- The dataset includes columns such as Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, and yearly population values.
- The main objectives of the project include:
**1. Data Cleaning and Preparation**

**2. Descriptive Statistics**

**3. Data Visualization**

**4. Analysis and Insights**

# Business Objective
- The primary business objective of this project is to provide actionable insights into global population trends that can inform strategic planning and decision-making.
- By understanding historical population data and identifying key patterns, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions in areas such as:
  
**Urban Planning and Development:**
   Plan for infrastructure development and resource allocation based on population growth trends.
   
**Healthcare Services:**
   Anticipate healthcare needs and services for regions with rapidly growing populations.
   
**Market Research and Expansion:**
   Identify potential markets for business expansion by analyzing population demographics.

**Policy Formulation:**
   Develop policies that address the needs of diverse populations and promote sustainable growth.

**Educational Planning:**
   Forecast educational needs and allocate resources to regions with high population growth.

   # Steps for projects:

   **1.Import necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization.**
   **2.Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.**
   **3Display the first 10 and last rows of the DataFrame to get an overview of the data.**
   **Get the number of rows and columns in the dataset using df.shape: Returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the DataFrame.**
   **Display information about the DataFrame, including the data types and non-null values using df.info(): Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame.**
   **Generate descriptive statistics of the dataset using df.describe(): Provides a summary for numerical columns, including mean, standard deviation, min, and max values.**
   **Display the names of the columns in the DataFrame using df.columns: Returns the column labels of the DataFrame.**
   **Check for duplicate rows in the dataset using df.duplicated().sum(): Counts the number of duplicate rows and df.duplicated().value_counts(): Provides the frequency of unique and duplicate rows.**
   **Check for missing values in each column of the DataFrame using df.isnull().sum(): Returns the number of missing values in each column.**
   **Find the number of unique values in each column using df.nunique(): Counts the number of unique values per column.**
   **Display unique values in specific columns and count the unique entries.**
   - df['Country Name'].unique(): Lists unique country names.
   - df['Country Name'].nunique(): Counts unique country names.
   - df['Country Code'].unique(): Lists unique country codes.
   - df['Country Code'].nunique(): Counts unique country codes.

  **Remove the 'Indicator Name' column as it may not be needed for the analysis by using df.drop(['Indicator Name'], axis=1): Drops the specified column from the DataFrame
  and using df.shape: Check the new shape of the DataFrame.**

  **Visualize the distribution of data across all numerical columns.
  using df.hist(figsize=(16, 12), bins=50, log=True): Creates a histogram for each numerical column with log scaling.**

  **Select numeric columns and calculate their skewness to understand the data distribution using df.select_dtypes(include=['number']): Selects only numeric columns.
  and numeric_df.skew(): Calculates skewness for each numeric column.**

  **Filter the DataFrame to include only rows where the 'Indicator Code' is 'SP.POP.TOTL', representing total population using df[df['Indicator Code'] == 'SP.POP.TOTL']: Filters the DataFrame.**

  **Sort the DataFrame by the population in 2023 in descending order using df.sort_values(by='2023', ascending=False): Sorts the DataFrame.**

  **Extract the top 10 most populated countries in 2023 using df.head(10): Gets the first 10 rows of the DataFrame.**

  **Create a bar chart to visualize the top 10 most populated countries in 2023 using
   sns.barplot(): Creates a bar plot.
   plt.xticks(rotation=45): Rotates the x-axis labels for better readability.
   plt.tight_layout(): Adjusts the layout to prevent label cut-off.**

  **Extract the bottom 10 least populated countries in 2023 using 
   df.sort_values(by='2023', ascending=True): Sorts the DataFrame in ascending order.**

  **Create a bar chart to visualize the bottom 10 least populated countries in 2023.
   sns.barplot(...): Creates a bar plot.
   plt.xticks(rotation=45): Rotates the x-axis labels for better readability.
   plt.tight_layout(): Adjusts the layout to prevent label cut-off.**

  **Create a grouped bar chart to visualize population trends over the years for the top 3 most populated countries.**

  **Plot a histogram to show the distribution of populations in 2023.**
  
  **Compare the distribution of populations in 1960 and 2023 with a grouped histogram.**

  **Create a stacked bar chart for the population over years for the top 3 most populated countries.**

  **Generate a summary table for selected years including total, mean, min, and max population values.**
   

# Conclusion
- The Global Population Trends Data Visualization project has provided a comprehensive analysis of population data from 1960 to 2023, offering valuable insights into demographic changes across different countries. Through data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and a variety of visualizations, we have uncovered key patterns and trends in the global population landscape.

**Key takeaways from this project include:**

## Identification of Demographic Patterns:

- We identified the most and least populated countries and observed significant growth trends in specific regions.
- The data revealed how population sizes have evolved over the decades, highlighting periods of rapid growth and stability.
  
## Insightful Visualizations:

- Bar charts and line plots effectively showcased the population sizes and trends for top countries.
- Histograms provided a clear view of population distributions, emphasizing shifts and changes over time.
- Grouped and stacked bar charts offered a comparative perspective, making it easier to analyze and understand complex data.
- 
## Business and Policy Implications:

-The insights gained can assist urban planners, healthcare providers, market researchers, and policymakers in making informed decisions.
-By understanding population dynamics, stakeholders can develop strategies that address the needs of growing populations and promote sustainable development.

## Data-Driven Decision Making:

- The project emphasized the importance of using data-driven approaches to analyze and interpret population data.
- Visualizations not only made the data more accessible but also highlighted trends that might have been overlooked in raw data.
